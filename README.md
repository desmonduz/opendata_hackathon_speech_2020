# Notebooks for Open Data Hackathon 2020

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for 2 speeches delivered at Open Data Hackathon 2020.

# Datasets

Below are the links to datasets used in this speech.
- [California Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices) - contains spatial coordinates for exploratory analysis on maps. Housing prices are usually predicted using regression models, however classication can be done for multiple price categories.
- [Forest Fires](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires) - contains spatial coordinates for exploratory analysis on maps. Gaussian SVM works well at predicting the fire affected area.
- [Student Knowledge Level](https://code.datasciencedojo.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/tree/master/User%20Knowledge%20Modeling) - good for exploratory analysis using scatter plots, heatmaps and hierarchical clustering dendograms. Naive Bayes can predict the student's knowledge level.
- [Student Performance in Learning Math and Portugese](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance) - exploratory analysis can be accomplished using scatter plots, heatmaps, tree-maps, polar charts, etc. Naive Bayes and SVM can be used to predict if student passes the subject without using information about her grades.
